## Requirements  
#### Feature Tasks 
##### expense
* in this app an expense should contain at least the following properties
  * `id` a uuid
  * `categoryID` an id that corresponds to an existing category
  * `timestamp` a date from when the category was created
  * `name` a string that is the name of the category
  * `price` a number that is the total amount of $ in the category 
  * feel free to add more to your expense

##### redux
###### app reducer
* export a reducer that holds the entire app state from `reducer/index.js`
* create a reducer that will combine your categories reducer and expenses reducer

###### expenses reducer
* create a category reducer in your your reducer directory
* this reducer should support the following interactions 
  * `EXPENSE_CREATE` -- store an expense
  * `EXPENSE_UPDATE` -- update an existing expense
  * `EXPENSE_DELETE` -- delete an existing expense
* if you need others feel free to add them

###### action creators
* you should create an action creator for each interaction supported by your expenses reducer

###### store
* in `lib/store.js` exports a function that will return a redux store from your app reducer

##### Components
Create the following components and structure them according to the following diagram.  
``` 
App
  Provider 
    BrowserRouter
      Route / Dashboard
        CategoryForm -- for creating categories
        [CategoryItem] -- list of CategoryItems
           CategoryForm  -- for updating categories
           ExpenseForm -- for creating expenses
           [ExpenseItem]  -- list of ExpenseItems
              ExpenseForm -- for updating an expense
```

###### Update the CategoryItem Component
* should keep all of the features described in lab-31
* add an ExpenseForm to your category item that enables the user to create expenses on your app state
* display a list of all the ExpenseItems belonging to the category

##### ExpenseItem Component 
* should have a button that will delete the expense from the Apps `onClick`
* should display the `name` and `price` of the component
* should display an ExpenseForm that will enable the user to update the expense in the app state
